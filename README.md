## Python.Arista.shutdown_ports

The scope of this project is to automate the process of shutting down 
<br>unused ports on an Arista switch. It is a best practice for unused ports on a switch
<br>to be shutdown and put in a quarantine vlan.
 

## Usage

The project is made of just 1 python file. It was written in Python 2.7.
<br>The script was made to administratively shutdown port (Ethernet , not Management)
<br>that are down and that are in access mode or trunk. But the script can be easily modified to shutdown
<br>ports that are in a particular vlan or have some particular description for example.
